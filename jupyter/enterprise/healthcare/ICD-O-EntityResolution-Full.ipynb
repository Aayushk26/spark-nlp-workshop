    "A 35-year-old African-American man was referred to our urology clinic by his primary care physician for consultation about a large left scrotal mass. The patient reported a 3-month history of left scrotal swelling that had progressively increased in size and was associated with mild left scrotal pain. He also had complaints of mild constipation, with hard stools every other day. He denied any urinary complaints. On physical examination, a hard paratesticular mass could be palpated in the left hemiscrotum extending into the left groin, separate from the left testicle, and measuring approximately 10 × 7 cm in size. A hard, lower abdominal mass in the suprapubic region could also be palpated in the midline. The patient was admitted urgently to the hospital for further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging and blood work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laboratory results, including results of a complete blood cell count with differential, liver function tests, coagulation panel, and basic chemistry panel, were unremarkable except for a serum creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. Typical markers for a testicular germ cell tumor were within normal limits: the beta–human chorionic gonadotropin level was less than 1 mIU/mL and the alpha fetoprotein level was less than 2.8 ng/mL. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast was obtained, and it showed large multifocal intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic masses (Figure 1). On cross-sectional imaging, a 7.8-cm para-aortic mass was visualized compressing the proximal portion of the left ureter, creating moderate left hydroureteronephrosis. Additionally, three separate pelvic masses were present in the retrovesical space, each measuring approximately 5 to 10 cm at their largest diameter; these displaced the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patient underwent ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of one of the pelvic masses on hospital day 3 for definitive diagnosis. Microscopic examination of the tissue by our pathologist revealed cellular islands with oval to elongated, irregular, and hyperchromatic nuclei; scant cytoplasm; and invading fibrous tissue—as well as three mitoses per high-powered field (Figure 2). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated strong positivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, vimentin, and desmin. Further mutational analysis of the cells detected the presence of an EWS-WT1 fusion transcript consistent with a diagnosis of desmoplastic small round cell tumor.\n",

    "A 72-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia self-palpated a left submandibular lump in 2012. Complete blood count (CBC) in his internist’s office showed solitary leukocytosis (white count 22) with predominant lymphocytes for which he was referred to a hematologist. Peripheral blood flow cytometry on 04/11/12 confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL): abnormal cell population comprising 63% of CD45 positive leukocytes, co-expressing CD5 and CD23 in CD19-positive B cells. CD38 was negative but other prognostic markers were not assessed at that time. The patient was observed regularly for the next 3 years and his white count trend was as follows: 22.8 (4/2012) --> 28.5 (07/2012) --> 32.2 (12/2012) --> 36.5 (02/2013) --> 42 (09/2013) --> 44.9 (01/2014) --> 75.8 (2/2015). His other counts stayed normal until early 2015 when he also developed anemia (hemoglobin [HGB] 10.9) although platelets remained normal at 215. He had been noticing enlargement of his cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy for several months since 2014 and a positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan done in 12/2014 had shown extensive diffuse lymphadenopathy within the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) was similar to low baseline activity within the vasculature of the neck and chest. In the abdomen and pelvis, however, there was mild to moderately hypermetabolic adenopathy measuring up to SUV of 4. The largest right neck nodes measured up to 2.3 x 3 cm and left neck nodes measured up to 2.3 x 1.5 cm. His right axillary lymphadenopathy measured up to 5.5 x 2.6 cm and on the left measured up to 4.8 x 3.4 cm. Lymph nodes on the right abdomen and pelvis measured up to 6.7 cm and seemed to have some mass effect with compression on the urinary bladder without symptoms. He underwent a bone marrow biopsy on 02/03/15, which revealed hypercellular marrow (60%) with involvement by CLL (30%); flow cytometry showed CD38 and ZAP-70 positivity; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed 13q deletion/monosomy 13; IgVH was unmutated; karyotype was 46XY.\n",
