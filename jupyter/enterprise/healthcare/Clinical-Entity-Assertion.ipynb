    "## Example for Named Entity Recognition with Assertion Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A common NLP problem in biomedical aplications is to identify the presence of clinical entities in a given text. This clinical entities could be diseases, symptoms, drugs, results of clinical investigations or others.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just identifying the presence of a clinical entity in an unestructured content is not enough for most of real world applications. As clinical care is full of uncertainty, in practice many of the entities refered in a medical record will not be really present in the patient but are mentioned just as working hypothesis, or identify a condition that want to be ruled out by means of a complementary test, or a condition being prevented by an intervention (for instance \"patient was vaccinated against hepatitis B\" does not imply that patient suffering from hepatitis B). In other cases a disease is mentioned associated with a relative of the patient (as in \"Father with Alzheimer disease\") as those family history is a risk factor in diseases with a genetic component.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to extract this information from the content the Spark-NLP enterprise version includes an Assertion annotator that based in a Machine Learning pretrained model will assign, for every entity identified, a tag that informs about the nature of that entity in terms of certainty: \"present\", \"absent\", \"hypothesis\", \"conditional\", \"associated_with_other_person\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use Spark-NLP to identify some entities present in a a list of sentences adding an assertion about their certainty."
